# IDEA EDU Course ...

Implemented in the Track 'SQL with Python' of hyperskill.org's JetBrains Academy.

## Technology / External Libraries

- Python 3.10.8,
- with packages: sqlite3, argparse, scikit-learn, tox, black and isort

## Repository Contents

The sources of main project tasks (5 stages) and testing.

## Program description

The toy project implements a simple Python backend that will allow to populate an SQLite3 database with recipes. 
We deal from Python with an auto-increment primary key and use foreign keys to create relationships
between tables. We work with many-to-many relations, with SQL queries, and with database cursor methods.

Have fun!
